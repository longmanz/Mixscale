\arguments{
\item{Y}{any matrix-like object (e.g. `matrix()`, `DelayedArray()`, `HDF5Matrix()`) with
one column per sample and row per gene.}

\item{model_matrix}{a numeric matrix that specifies the experimental
design. It can be produced using \code{stats::model.matrix()}.
Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{offset}{Constant offset in the model in addition to \code{log(size_factors)}. It can
either be a single number, a vector of length \code{ncol(data)} or a matrix with the
same dimensions as \code{dim(data)}. Note that if data is a \link{DelayedArray} or \link{HDF5Matrix},
\code{offset} must be as well. Default: \code{0}.}

\item{size_factors}{in large scale experiments, each sample is typically of different size
(for example different sequencing depths). A size factor is an internal mechanism of GLMs to
correct for this effect.\cr
\code{size_factors} is either a numeric vector with positive entries that has the same lengths as columns in the data
that specifies the size factors that are used.
Or it can be a string that species the method that is used to estimate the size factors
(one of \code{c("normed_sum", "deconvolution", "poscounts")}).
Note that \code{"normed_sum"} and \code{"poscounts"} are fairly
simple methods and can lead to suboptimal results. For the best performance, I recommend to use
\code{size_factors = "deconvolution"} which calls \code{scran::calculateSumFactors()}. However, you need
to separately install the \code{scran} package from Bioconductor for this method to work.
Also note that \code{size_factors = 1} and \code{size_factors = FALSE} are equivalent. If only a single gene is given,
no size factor is estimated (ie. \code{size_factors = 1}). Default: \code{"normed_sum"}.}

\item{overdispersion}{the simplest count model is the Poisson model. However, the Poisson model
assumes that \eqn{variance = mean}. For many applications this is too rigid and the Gamma-Poisson
allows a more flexible mean-variance relation (\eqn{variance = mean + mean^2 * overdispersion}). \cr
\code{overdispersion} can either be
\itemize{
\item a single boolean that indicates if an overdispersion is estimated for each gene.
\item a numeric vector of length \code{nrow(data)} fixing the overdispersion to those values.
\item the string \code{"global"} to indicate that one dispersion is fit across all genes.
}
Note that \code{overdispersion = 0} and \code{overdispersion = FALSE} are equivalent and both reduce
the Gamma-Poisson to the classical Poisson model. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{overdispersion_shrinkage}{the overdispersion can be difficult to estimate with few replicates. To
improve the overdispersion estimates, we can share information across genes and shrink each individual
overdispersion estimate towards a global overdispersion estimate. Empirical studies show however that
the overdispersion varies based on the mean expression level (lower expression level => higher
dispersion). If \code{overdispersion_shrinkage = TRUE}, a median trend of dispersion and expression level is
fit and used to estimate the variances of a quasi Gamma Poisson model (Lund et al. 2012). Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ridge_penalty}{to avoid overfitting, we can penalize fits with large coefficient estimates. Instead
of directly minimizing the deviance per gene (\eqn{Sum dev(y_i, X_i b)}), we will minimize
\eqn{Sum dev(y_i, X_i b) + N * Sum (penalty_p * b_p)^2}.\cr
\code{ridge_penalty} can be
\itemize{
\item a scalar in which case all parameters except the intercept are penalized.
\item a vector which has to have the same length as columns in the model matrix
\item a matrix with the same number of columns as columns in the model matrix. This gives
maximum flexibility for expert users and allows for full Tikhonov regularization.
}
Default: \code{ridge_penalty = 0}, which is internally replaced with a small positive number for numerical stability.}

\item{do_cox_reid_adjustment}{the classical maximum likelihood estimator of the \code{overdisperion} is biased
towards small values. McCarthy \emph{et al.} (2012) showed that it is preferable to optimize the Cox-Reid
adjusted profile likelihood.\cr
\code{do_cox_reid_adjustment} can be either be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} to indicate if the adjustment is
added during the optimization of the \code{overdispersion} parameter. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{subsample}{the estimation of the overdispersion is the slowest step when fitting
a Gamma-Poisson GLM. For datasets with many samples, the estimation can be considerably sped up
without loosing much precision by fitting the overdispersion only on a random subset of the samples.
Default: \code{FALSE} which means that the data is not subsampled. If set to \code{TRUE}, at most 1,000 samples
are considered. Otherwise the parameter just specifies the number of samples that are considered
for each gene to estimate the overdispersion.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean that indicates if information about the individual steps are printed
while fitting the GLM. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
